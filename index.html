                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Michael received his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University in 2017. Initially preparing for a career in aerospace by interning as a Testing Engineer at GE Aviation, he was later swayed towards one in robotics after studying mechatronics, competing in a robotics competition, and partaking in an automation project for his senior capstone.</p>

        <p>Michael grew up in Schiller Park, Illinois and enjoys reading, cooking, and gaming. Now as a student of the MSR program, he is continuously building his repertoire of skills that will prepare him for a career in automation.</p>

                                    <h4>Project Obectives</h4>
                                    <p>The purpose of this project is to design a device that manufactures robotic whisker sensors by drawing polymer plastic filament from an oven. It must be able to inspect the diameter of the whisker and adjust the draw speed accordingly to match a specific geometric profile. This process must be quick and repeatable.</p>
                                    <p>The image below shows how the shape of the filament develops over time. The heated length of the filament is brought to the plastic's glass transition temperature. Then the filament is pulled away from the oven by the drawing mechanism to create a taper.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/images/whisker/whisker_drawing.png" alt="Whisker Drawing">
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>The artificial whisker geometric profile imitates that of a biological whisker at a 5x scale (see image below). These dimensions drove the design specifications for the drawing mechanism.</p>

                                    <p>Given the dimensions of an artificial whisker, the mechanism must:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Include a linear actuator that can draw a 250 mm whisker in approx. 2 mins</li>
                                        <li>Acheive a velocity range of 0.01 mm/s - 10 mm/s</li>
                                        <li>Include velocity feedback control to regulate the whisker taper</li>
                                        <li>Have computer vision to inspect the whisker diameter in micrometers</li>

                                    <h4>System Design</h4>
                                    <p>A block diagram of the system is depicted below. The Raspberry Pi controls the velocity of the lead screw linear actuator via the Tic motor controller. A High Quality Raspberry Pi camera is connected to the RasPi.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/images/whisker/block_diagram.png" alt="Block Diagram">
                                    <p>This setup allows the device to perform the following closed control loop. In order to acheive the proper whisker taper, the RasPi is provided a desired whisker diameter and sends the Tic a command to speed up or slow down the motor velocity based on the camera's examination of the whisker.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/images/whisker/control_loop.png">
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>A 12" hollow cylinder of heavy duty alumnium foil was created for the filament to travel through in order to heat up to its glass transition temperature. The heating element within the heat tray was found using a thermal camera smart phone attachment (see image below), and the aluminum foil cylinder was placed above and in parallel with one fold of the heating element.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/images/whisker/setup_thermal.jpg">
                                    <p>The finished setup looks like this:</p>
                                    <img src="assets/images/whisker/setup_labeled.png">
                                    <h4>Computer Vision</h4>
                                    <p>In order to accurately measure the whisker diameter, the camera and lens must be first focused on a calibration slide's 1mm x 1mm reticle stacked on top of a sample of the plastic filament, as shown in the image below.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/images/whisker/whisker_calibration.png">
                                    <p>Next, I used the script cam_calibration.cpp, which can be found on my GitHub, to measure the reticle in pixels and calculate pixels/μm (displayed below). This project is still a work in progress, so the next step is to finish the script whisker.cpp which takes the pixels/μm constant, measures the diameter of the whisker section that is directly outside the oven, and performs the velocity control loop.</p>

                                <p>This quadrotor was designed using a F450 frame, CC3D flight controller, and 1000KV brushless motors. The flight controller was programmed using the open source program, LibrePilot. Currently, this drone can be flown by an RC trasmitter, but the next step is to implement autonomous flight. This will be done by connecting the flight controller to a Raspberry Pi via USB and executing a program that sends the drone on a predetermined flight path.</p>

                                <p class="summary">The goal for this project was to build a working prototype for a mechanism that can automate the construction of airplane cabins. In collaboration with Boeing and the Northwestern Robotics lab, my team and I approached this challenge by designing a six degree of freedom system that consisted of a gimbal attached to three motorized legs. This machine was designed to be mounted on a mecanum wheel robot for the purpose of transporting large airplane parts in to position for assembly. With three of these robots working in sync, they would be able to move an airplane part into any configuration for assembly.</p>

                                <p class="summary">The Northwestern Robotics Competition is an annual event that can be taken as a course with a different objective each year. In 2016, teams were challenged to create a robot that can navigate an obstacle course made of foam pool noodles that sat on a raised platform. On the opposite end of the course was a plastic cup wrapped in reflective tape that sits on a small, wheeled platform that was remote controlled by another team. The robot needed to autonomously detect the cup and knock it over.
                                My team designed a three-wheeled robot with a propeller at the head to knock over the cup. The propeller was made from a high RPM motor, a 3D printed coupler, and two large zip ties. Laser and photodiode pairings were used to detect the cup as well as detect if the robot was near the edge of the obstacle course.</p>
